## Introduce to the TOC

* News(3+): Deno news on Github repo, Discord, Reddit, or Twitter, etc.
* Articles(3+): Solitary articles include articles that have been published a while.
* Articles - Chinese(0+): Solitary articles from the Chinese community.
* Resources(0+): Videos, Ebooks, Tutorials, Discussions, Forum Posts, and more.
* Project(0+): After deep into one project's philosophy and its source code, share it in issues.

## Workflow

In every two week, I'll try to:

* First week, focus on reading articles, and reading source code.
* First week, publish translation articles from last week.
* Second week, focus on collecting news and translate articles.
* Second week, if not choose to translate, write an original one instead.
* Second week, publish Deno Feedly's new issue with two language vision.
* Remember: Make adequate preparation to collect, organize, format, translate, and publish.

## Growth Wish

Not just collecting infos and use much time to write and publish, but also trough the collecting:

* Find my next original/translate article idea.
* Find more Github repo (including mine) to make a contribution.
* Make sure all the collected articles and resources I had learned patiently.
* **Important Notice**: Make sure every week, spend a few hours in study, don't make the second week too heavy.
* Learn the newest Deno new Tech knowledge as quick as possible.
